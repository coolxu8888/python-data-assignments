# Scrape Logic
This project aim to produce a direct outcome of hottag being disscussed on a local building design forum. It first shows the outcome of topic title of the discussion, then by using keyword extraction method to extract the frequently discussed words out of title. Then I double check if there is a same outcome if we scrape the hottags from the original article. At last, I creat two charts to compare the hottags drawn from the topic titles and from original articles. From the charts we can see that the frequently mentioned words in this forum is 'interview', 'UED', 'city' and 'architecture'.
